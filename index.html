            <h2>Details of Treaty 5</h2>
            <h3>1. Communities Involved and Their Backgrounds</h3>
            <p>Treaty 5 was an agreement between the Canadian government, the Ojibwe people, and the Swampy Cree of Lake Winnipeg. It included lands in central and northern Manitoba, and parts of Saskatchewan and Ontario. The Norway House band, as well as communities like Berens River, Fisher River, and different Cree groups (from Cross Lake, Oxford House, and The Pas), were also part of the treaty. More communities joined between 1907 and 1910.</p>

            <h3>2. Main Terms of Treaty 5</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>One-time payment:</strong> $5 per person when signing the treaty (compared to $12 in Treaties 3 and 4).</li>
                <li><strong>Land per family:</strong> 160 acres of land per family, which is less than what was given in Treaties 3 and 4.</li>
                <li><strong>Yearly payments:</strong> $5 per person, $15 for each headman, and $25 for each chief.</li>
                <li><strong>Extra items:</strong> Tools, ammunition, twine, flags, clothing, and medals were also given.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Additional Promises and Land Issues</h3>
            <p>Besides the treaty terms, other promises were made, such as offering new reserves for those who moved. For example, Norway House band members were relocated to Fisher River, and $500 was provided to help some groups, like those in Grand Rapids, with moving costs. However, there were challenges in managing these promises, including confusion about reserve boundaries and requests for more or different land.</p>

            <h3>4. Differences Between Treaty 5 and Other Treaties in Canada</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Less Generous Terms:</strong> Treaty 5 offered less money and land than Treaties 3 and 4. The one-time payment was $5, which was lower than the earlier treaties, and the land provided was also less.</li>
                <li><strong>Government Reluctance:</strong> The government was initially reluctant to negotiate Treaty 5 because they had already secured more valuable farmland through Treaties 1 to 4. The main aim was to open up the Lake Winnipeg area for transportation and resource extraction rather than agriculture.</li>
                <li><strong>Later Inclusion of Northern Communities:</strong> Many northern Indigenous communities were only included from 1907 to 1910, as the government aimed to secure land for building railways and accessing resources.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Treaty 5 Today</h3>
            <p>
                Today, the terms of Treaty 5 still shape the lives of Indigenous communities, particularly in relation to land rights and resource management. 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Economic Development:</strong> While there isn't a single organization representing all Treaty 5 communities, some are part of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN). NAN focuses on protecting treaty rights, pursuing self-government, and supporting economic and cultural development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ongoing Issues:</strong> Many communities continue to face challenges related to the management of reserve boundaries and promises that were not fully met. These issues have had long-term effects on Indigenous livelihoods and land use.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
