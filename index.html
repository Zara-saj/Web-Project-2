            <h3>1. Communities Involved and Their Backgrounds</h3>
            <p>Treaty 5 was an agreement between the Canadian government, the Ojibwe people, and the Swampy Cree of Lake Winnipeg. 
                It included lands in central and northern Manitoba, and parts of Saskatchewan and Ontario.</p>

            <!-- Subsection 2: Main Terms of Treaty 5 -->

            <ul>
                <li><strong>One-time payment:</strong> $5 per person when signing the treaty (compared to $12 in Treaties 3 and 4).</li>
                <li><strong>Land per family:</strong> 160 acres of land per family, which is less than what was given in Treaties 3 and 4.</li>
                <li><strong>Yearly payments:</strong> $5 per person, $15 for each headman, and $25 for each chief.</li>

                <li><strong>Government Reluctance:</strong> Initially reluctant to negotiate Treaty 5 due to existing farmlands from earlier 
                    treaties.</li>
                <li><strong>Later Inclusion:</strong> Northern Indigenous communities were only included from 1907 to 1910.</li>
